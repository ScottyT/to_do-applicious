The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy.  They can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled by the callback function.\n\nAll examples will work with the pure javascript bindings (currently default) or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings (currently in beta)\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n### Info\n\n* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* _heavily_ tested\n  * the same suite of 200+ integration tests passed by both javascript & libpq bindings\n  * benchmark & long-running memory leak tests performed before releases\n  * tested with with\n    * postgres 8.x, 9.x\n    * Linux, OS X\n    * node 2.x & 4.x\n* row-by-row result streaming\n* built-in (optional) connection pooling\n* responsive project maintainer\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications\n  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion \n* query queue\n* active development\n* fast\n* close mirror of the node-mysql api for future multi-database-supported ORM implementation ease\n\n### Contributors\n\nMany thanks to the following:\n\n* [creationix](https://github.com/creationix)\n* [felixge](https://github.com/felixge)\n* [pshc](https://github.com/pshc)\n* [pjornblomqvist](https://github.com/bjornblomqvist)\n* [JulianBirch](https://github.com/JulianBirch)\n* [ef4](https://github.com/ef4)\n* [napa3um](https://github.com/napa3um)\n* [drdaeman](https://github.com/drdaeman)\n* [booo](https://github.com/booo)\n* [neonstalwart](https://github.com/neonstalwart)\n* [homme](https://github.com/homme)\n* [bdunavant](https://github.com/bdunavant)\n* [tokumine](https://github.com/tokumine)\n* [shtylman](https://github.com/shtylman)\n* [cricri](https://github.com/cricri)\n* [AlexanderS](https://github.com/AlexanderS)\n* [ahtih](https://github.com/ahtih)\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n### __PLEASE__ check out the WIKI\n\nIf you have a question, post it to the FAQ section of the WIKI so everyone can read the answer\n\n## Production Use\n* [yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com)\n* [bayt.com](http://bayt.com)\n\n_if you use node-postgres in production and would like your site listed here, fork & add it_\n\n## Help\n\nIf you need help or run into _any_ issues getting node-postgres to work on your system please report a bug or contact me directly.

Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install pg\n    \n## Examples\n\n### Callbacks\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); \n//or native libpq bindings\n//var pg = require('pg').native\n\nvar conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\n//note: error handling omitted\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  client.query('SELECT NOW() AS \"theTime\"', function(err, result) {\n      console.log(result.rows[0].theTime);\n      //output: Tue Jan 15 2013 19:12:47 GMT-600 (CST)\n  })\n});\n\n```\n\n### Events\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); //native libpq bindings = `var pg = require('pg').native`\nvar conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect();\n\n//queries are queued and executed one after another once the connection becomes available\nclient.query(\"CREATE TEMP TABLE beatles(name varchar(10), height integer, birthday timestamptz)\");\nclient.query(\"INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)\", ['John', 68, new Date(1944, 10, 13)]);\nvar query = client.query(\"SELECT * FROM beatles WHERE name = $1\", ['John']);\n\n//can stream row results back 1 at a time\nquery.on('row', function(row) {\n  console.log(row);\n  console.log(\"Beatle name: %s\", row.name); //Beatle name: John\n  console.log(\"Beatle birth year: %d\", row.birthday.getYear()); //dates are returned as javascript dates\n  console.log(\"Beatle height: %d' %d\\\"\", Math.floor(row.height/12), row.height%12); //integers are returned as javascript ints\n});\n\n//fired after last row is emitted\nquery.on('end', function() { \n  client.end();\n});\n```\n\n### Example notes\n\nnode-postgres supports both an 'event emitter' style API and a 'callback' style.  The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy when you want to handle row events as they come in.  \n\nThey can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled within the callback function.\n\nAll examples will work with the pure javascript bindings or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n### Features\n\n* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* row-by-row result streaming\n* responsive project maintainer\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion\n\n## Heads Up!!\n\nnode-postgres is __very__ near to v1.0.0 release.  Up until now I've tried to maintain all backwards compatilbity, but there are a few breaking changes the community has recommended I introduce.\n\nThe current version will spit out deprecation warnings when you use the soon-to-be-deprecated features.  They're meant to be obtrusive and annoying.  Understandable if you'd like to disable them.\n\nYou can do so like this: `pg.defaults.hideDeprecationWarnings = true;`\n\nThese are the breaking changes: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/pull/301\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n### __PLEASE__ check out the WIKI\n\nIf you have a question, post it to the FAQ section of the WIKI so everyone can read the answer\n\n## Production Use\n* [yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com)\n* [bayt.com](http://bayt.com)\n* [bitfloor.com](https://bitfloor.com)\n* [Vendly](http://www.vend.ly)\n* [SaferAging](http://www.saferaging.com)\n\n_if you use node-postgres in production and would like your site listed here, fork & add it_\n\n## Contributing\n\n__I love contributions.__\n\nYou are welcome contribute via pull requests.

Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install pg\n    \n## Examples\n\n### Callbacks\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); \n//or native libpq bindings\n//var pg = require('pg').native\n\nvar conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\n//note: error handling omitted\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  client.query('SELECT NOW() AS \"theTime\"', function(err, result) {\n      console.log(result.rows[0].theTime);\n      //output: Tue Jan 15 2013 19:12:47 GMT-600 (CST)\n  })\n});\n\n```\n\n### Events\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); //native libpq bindings = `var pg = require('pg').native`\nvar conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect();\n\n//queries are queued and executed one after another once the connection becomes available\nclient.query(\"CREATE TEMP TABLE beatles(name varchar(10), height integer, birthday timestamptz)\");\nclient.query(\"INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)\", ['John', 68, new Date(1944, 10, 13)]);\nvar query = client.query(\"SELECT * FROM beatles WHERE name = $1\", ['John']);\n\n//can stream row results back 1 at a time\nquery.on('row', function(row) {\n  console.log(row);\n  console.log(\"Beatle name: %s\", row.name); //Beatle name: John\n  console.log(\"Beatle birth year: %d\", row.birthday.getYear()); //dates are returned as javascript dates\n  console.log(\"Beatle height: %d' %d\\\"\", Math.floor(row.height/12), row.height%12); //integers are returned as javascript ints\n});\n\n//fired after last row is emitted\nquery.on('end', function() { \n  client.end();\n});\n```\n\n### Example notes\n\nnode-postgres supports both an 'event emitter' style API and a 'callback' style.  The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy when you want to handle row events as they come in.  \n\nThey can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled within the callback function.\n\nAll examples will work with the pure javascript bindings or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n### Features\n\n* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* row-by-row result streaming\n* responsive project maintainer\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion\n\n## Heads Up!!\n\nnode-postgres is __very__ near to v1.0.0 release.  Up until now I've tried to maintain all backwards compatilbity, but there are a few breaking changes the community has recommended I introduce.\n\nThe current version will spit out deprecation warnings when you use the soon-to-be-deprecated features.  They're meant to be obtrusive and annoying.  Understandable if you'd like to disable them.\n\nYou can do so like this: `pg.defaults.hideDeprecationWarnings = true;`\n\nThese are the breaking changes: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/pull/301\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n### __PLEASE__ check out the WIKI\n\nIf you have a question, post it to the FAQ section of the WIKI so everyone can read the answer\n\n## Production Use\n* [yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com)\n* [bayt.com](http://bayt.com)\n* [bitfloor.com](https://bitfloor.com)\n* [Vendly](http://www.vend.ly)\n* [SaferAging](http://www.saferaging.com)\n\n_if you use node-postgres in production and would like your site listed here, fork & add it_\n\n## Contributing\n\n__I love contributions.__\n\nYou are welcome contribute via pull requests.

The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy when you want to handle row events as they come in.  \n\nThey can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled within the callback function.\n\nAll examples will work with the pure javascript bindings or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n### Features\n\n* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* row-by-row result streaming\n* responsive project maintainer\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion\n\n## Heads Up!!\n\nnode-postgres is __very__ near to v1.0.0 release.  Up until now I've tried to maintain all backwards compatilbity, but there are a few breaking changes the community has recommended I introduce.\n\nThe current version will spit out deprecation warnings when you use the soon-to-be-deprecated features.  They're meant to be obtrusive and annoying.  Understandable if you'd like to disable them.\n\nYou can do so like this: `pg.defaults.hideDeprecationWarnings = true;`\n\nThese are the breaking changes: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/pull/301\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n### __PLEASE__ check out the WIKI\n\nIf you have a question, post it to the FAQ section of the WIKI so everyone can read the answer\n\n## Production Use\n* [yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com)\n* [bayt.com](http://bayt.com)\n* [bitfloor.com](https://bitfloor.com)\n* [Vendly](http://www.vend.ly)\n* [SaferAging](http://www.saferaging.com)\n\n_if you use node-postgres in production and would like your site listed here, fork & add it_\n\n## Contributing\n\n__I love contributions.__\n\nYou are welcome contribute via pull requests.
